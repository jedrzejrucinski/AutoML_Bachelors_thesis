**GOAL**

We conduct an expirement in order to gather data about model ensembles created by AutoML frameworks for the regression task. We focus on [AutoGluon](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/index.html) and [AutoSklearn](https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/master/) and aim to achieve conclusions about the form of the before mentioned ensembles. The expirement is carried out on a particular group of data sets from [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/).
